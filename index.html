            I just made my own blog website
          </div>
          <div class="post-content">
            Howdy, I'm Sami Bellabd, mostly known as SMB, and I just made my first blog website ever. What you're reading
            is the very first post on it. In fact this is the very first website that I shared online
            with the world. I'm generally an artist, but I'm also a web developer, and I thought making a blog site might be a good idea.
            I get to talk about myself in my own way, and express myself easily.
            <br><br>
            Though, I'm not really in a good mood these days, so I'm not really that excited about it to be honest,
            I've had some personal problems, but I'll manage. I know it's bad timing, but it's gonna be fine.
            I kinda was rushing this website, it's the reason why it looks basic and beginner-looking,
            I will eventually update the UI and design, and will also add features, but for now, we have this.
            <br><br>
            I hope whoever's reading my blog posts will enjoy doing so. Until we meet again.
